####Introduction
This program uses scheme to determine whether a word given to it is spelt correcly based on the dictionary it has.




####How it works
The words that are going to be checked for spelling is based on hash values. The strings get mapped to integers values respectively called the key. Then the key is hashed to its final hash value by using the multiplication method and the division method. The same procces occurs for the dictionary file. Two lists of hash values get created in which they word gets compared with the dicitonary to confirm if it is spelt correctly.
